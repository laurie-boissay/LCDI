# LCDI
A website for a board game association

online since February 24, 2020 :

The github page :
https://github.com/le-cercle-des-investigateurs


Volunteer work carried out for the purposes:
- learn to program;
- offer a showcase to this association;
- increase the number of active members of the association.


I used micro data to optimize referencing by Google.

Constraints:

The font used for the titles is that used by LCDI for years.

The colors of the site were to be matched with the banner of the association.

LCDI is an association of board games in Essonne.

On 02/16/20, I proposed to its president to create a website for LCDI.
We briefly discussed his expectations. The main objectives are to increase the visibility of the club and the conversion of visitors into players.

So I took SEO (Search Engine Optimization) courses on OpenClassrooms and I think I did a good job.

I carried out user interviews to define their needs. Those who already consult the association forum do so rather on PC. However, so as not to neglect those who surf on their mobile, the site is responsive, that is to say that it adapts to all types of screen. In this case, it adapts at least to phones and computers.

Users also want to see added on the site, in the future, a tool like a calendar to manage registrations and events. The Google tool seems restrictive to me. A survey on their forum is underway. The other solution I see would be a site with backend (data processing) and paid hosting.
